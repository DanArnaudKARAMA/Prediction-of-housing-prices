# Housing Price Prediction

An real estate agent is seeking assistance to predict house prices in various regions of the United States. It would be great if you could somehow create a model that allows them to input a few features of a house and receive an estimated price for the house. The real estate agent has asked if you could help them with your newfound data science skills. You agree and decide that linear regression might be a good way to solve this problem! To do this, the real estate agent provides you with information on a sample of 5000 houses in different regions of the United States. This information is contained in the data table: "Houses.csv."

This data table contains the following features:

- 'Average_Income': The average income of the residents in the city where the house is located.
- 'Average_Age': The average age of houses in the city where the house is located.
- 'Average_Rooms': The average number of rooms in houses in the city where the house is located.
- 'Average_Bedrooms': The average number of bedrooms in houses in the city where the house is located.
- 'Population': The population of the city where the house is located.
- 'Price': The selling price of the house.
- 'Address': The address of the house.

**Objective**: Apply supervised machine learning using linear regression to predict the price of a new house based on these features.
